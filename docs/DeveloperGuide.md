### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.

- At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

- [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
- [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
- [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
- [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

- defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
- implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

**API** : [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java))  
[Ui is the interface for the UI component. It provides the functionality of the Ui]

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

- executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
- listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
- keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java))  
[Logic is the interface for the Logic component. It shows you methods for executing commands and accessing the application's data for display in the UI.]

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

- When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
- All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)  
[Model is the interface for the model component. It encapsulates the application's data structures and business logic, providing methods to access and modify contact, wedding and task data.]

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

- stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object) and all `Wedding` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueWeddingList`).
- stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
- stores the currently 'selected' `Wedding` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Wedding>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
- stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
- does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

- can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
- inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are or will be implemented.

<br>

### 1. Creating a wedding

The `AddWeddingCommand` allows users to create new wedding events within the application. This is essential for wedding planners to keep track of different wedding events they are managing.

#### Implementation Details ####
The `AddWeddingCommand` is implemented by extending the base `Command` class. It uses prefixes such as `n/`, `d/`, and `l/`, specifying required data fields for weddingName, weddingDate, and weddingLocation respectively. Once the data fields are filled, a new Wedding is added. It implements the following operations:


* `execute(Model)` — Checks the current address book state by calling `model.hasWedding(toAdd)`, and throws a `CommandException` if a duplicate Wedding is found

* `addWedding(wedding)` — Adds the Wedding to the wedding list. This operation is exposed in the Model interface as `Model#addWedding(Wedding)`.

<br>
Given below is an example usage scenario of how the addition mechanism behaves when the user tries to add a wedding to the wedding list:

<br>

Step 1. The user launches the application, with some contacts already added to the address book.

Step 2. The user executes `addWedding` command with specific details (e.g., `addWedding n/John and Jane's Wedding d/20-Feb-2026 l/Marina Bay Sands`). The `AddWeddingCommand` will then call `execute()`, which checks whether there is a duplicate Wedding in the wedding list before calling `addWedding(Wedding)`.

<box type="info" seamless>
Note: If the weddingName, weddingDate, or weddingLocation provided is invalid, a `CommandException` will be thrown.
</box>

#### Sequence Diagram ####

<puml src="diagrams/createWedding.puml" alt="createWedding" />

<br>

#### Design considerations:
**Aspect: How wedding IDs are generated:**


**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Automatically generate sequential wedding IDs (W1, W2, etc.) in the Wedding model.

* Pros: Easier to implement and more intuitive for users.
* Cons: May have issues with ID conflicts if weddings are deleted and re-added.

Alternative 2: Allow users to specify their own wedding IDs.

* Pros: More flexibility for users to create meaningful identifiers.
* Cons: More complex to implement and potential for user errors with duplicate IDs.

<br>

### 2. Deleting a wedding

The `DeleteWeddingCommand` allows users to remove wedding events from the application. This is particularly useful for removing completed or canceled weddings.

#### Implementation Details ####
The `DeleteWeddingCommand` is implemented by extending the base `Command` class. It takes a `WeddingId` parameter to identify which wedding to delete. It implements the following operations:

* `execute(Model)` — Retrieves the wedding to delete using `model.getWeddingById(weddingId)`, throwing a `CommandException` if no matching wedding is found.
* `deleteWedding(weddingToDelete)` — Removes the Wedding from the wedding list.
* `removeTagFromAllContacts(tag)` — Removes the wedding tag from all contacts that were associated with the wedding.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the deletion mechanism behaves:

<br>

Step 1. The user executes `deleteWedding W1` to delete the wedding with ID W1.

Step 2. The `DeleteWeddingCommand` finds the wedding with ID W1 in the model and removes it.

Step 3. The command also finds all contacts tagged with W1 and removes that tag from them, ensuring data consistency.

#### Sequence Diagram #####

<puml src="diagrams/deleteWedding.puml" alt="deleteWedding" />

<br>

#### Design considerations:
**Aspect: How wedding deletion affects associated data:**

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Remove wedding tags from all contacts when a wedding is deleted.

* Pros: Maintains data consistency and prevents orphaned tags.
* Cons: Slightly more complex implementation and slower deletion operation.

Alternative 2: Keep the tags on contacts even when a wedding is deleted.

* Pros: Simpler implementation and faster deletion.
* Cons: Results in orphaned tags that reference non-existent weddings.

<br>

### 3. Tagging a contact to a wedding

The `TagCommand` allows users to associate contacts with specific wedding events. This is essential for keeping track of which vendors and clients are associated with each wedding.

#### Implementation Details #####
The `TagCommand` is implemented by extending the base `Command` class. It takes an `Index` parameter to identify the contact and a `WeddingId` to identify the wedding. It implements the following operations:

* `execute(Model)` — Retrieves the person at the specified index using `model.getFilteredPersonList()` and checks if the wedding exists.
* `tagPerson(person, tag)` — Associates the contact with the wedding by adding a tag.

Given below is an example usage scenario:


Step 1. The user executes `tag 1 W1` to tag the first contact in the list to wedding W1.

Step 2. The `TagCommand` retrieves the person at index 1 and creates a new tag with wedding ID W1.

Step 3. The command adds this tag to the person's tag set, creating an association between the contact and the wedding.

#### Sequence Diagram

<puml src="diagrams/tagContact.puml" alt="tagContact" />

<br>

#### Design considerations:
**Aspect: How wedding-contact associations are stored:**

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store the association as tags on Person objects.

* Pros: Leverages existing tag functionality, making implementation simpler.
* Cons: Limited metadata can be stored about the association.

Alternative 2: Create a separate association entity that links persons and weddings.

* Pros: Could store additional information about the role in the wedding.
* Cons: More complex to implement and manage.

<br>

### 4. Untagging a contact from a wedding

The `UntagCommand` allows users to remove associations between contacts and weddings. This is useful when a vendor or client is no longer involved with a specific wedding.

#### Implementation Details #####
The `UntagCommand` is implemented similarly to the `TagCommand`. It takes an `Index` parameter to identify the contact and a `WeddingId` to identify the wedding to untag. It implements:

* `execute(Model)` — Retrieves the person and checks if they have the specified wedding tag.
* `untagPerson(person, tag)` — Removes the wedding tag from the contact.

Given below is an example usage scenario:

Step 1. The user executes `untag 1 W1` to remove the association between the first contact and wedding W1.

Step 2. The `UntagCommand` checks if the person has the W1 tag and removes it if present.

#### Sequence Diagram
<puml src="diagrams/untagContact.puml" alt="untagContact" />

<br>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Handling non-existent tags in untag command:**

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Check if the tag exists before attempting to remove it.

* Pros: Provides clear error messages to users.
* Cons: Requires additional checks in the command execution.

Alternative 2: Silently ignore untag requests for non-existent tags.

* Pros: Simpler implementation.
* Cons: Less informative for users, who might not realize the tag didn't exist.

<br> 

### 5. Adding a task to a wedding

The `AddTaskCommand` allows users to add tasks to specific weddings. This helps wedding planners track what needs to be done for each wedding event.

#### Implementation Details ####

The `AddTaskCommand` extends the base `Command` class. It uses prefixes such as `w/` and `desc/` to specify the wedding ID and task description. It implements:

* `execute(Model)` — Finds the wedding using `model.getFilteredWeddingList()` and a predicate.
* `addTask(task)` — Adds the new task to the wedding's task list.

Given below is an example usage scenario:

Step 1. The user executes addTask `w/W1 desc/Book photographer` to add a new task to wedding W1.

Step 2. The `AddTaskCommand` finds wedding W1 and creates a new `WeddingTask` with the description.

Step 3. The command adds this task to the wedding's task list.

#### Sequence Diagram
<puml src="diagrams/addTask.puml" alt="addTask" />

<br>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Where tasks are stored:**

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store tasks directly in the Wedding object.

* Pros: Simplifies implementation and maintains clear ownership.
* Cons: Limited flexibility in sharing tasks across weddings.

Alternative 2: Store tasks separately with references to weddings.

* Pros: More flexible for potential future features like shared tasks.
* Cons: More complex data management.

<br>

### 6. Deleting a task from a wedding

The `DeleteTaskCommand` allows users to remove tasks from weddings. This is useful for removing completed tasks or tasks that are no longer relevant.

#### Implementation Details ####

The `DeleteTaskCommand` extends the base `Command` class. It uses prefixes `w/` for weddingID and `i/` for the task index. It implements:

* `execute(Model)` — Finds the wedding and validates the task index.
* `removeTask(index)` — Removes the task at the specified index from the wedding's task list.

Given below is an example usage scenario:

Step 1. The user executes `deleteTask w/W1 i/2` to delete the second task from wedding W1.

Step 2. The `DeleteTaskCommand` finds wedding W1 and removes the task at index 2 from its task list.

#### Sequence Diagram
<puml src="diagrams/deleteTask.puml" alt="deleteTask" />

<br>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How task indices are handled:**

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use 1-based indexing for users, converting to 0-based for internal operations.

* Pros: More intuitive for users who typically count from 1.
* Cons: Requires index conversion in command execution.

Alternative 2: Use 0-based indexing throughout the system.

* Pros: Consistent with internal array indexing.
* Cons: Less intuitive for non-technical users.

<br>

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

- `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
- `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
- `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.

  - Pros: Easy to implement.
  - Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

- **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  - Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  - Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Effort**

### Project Scope and Difficulty
This project was much more tedious than the Address Book (AB3) reference project.  
While AB3 deals exclusively with one entity type (Persons), our project, EasyWeds, expands its scope by incorporating multiple entities, Weddings and tasks, and establishing links between them.  
This broader scope required a more robust data model and detailed planning for application logic, especially for actions that involve managing interdependencies.

**Key challenges included:**

- **Entity Linking:** Establish reliable relationships between contacts, weddings, and tasks.
- **Testing and Coverage:** Ensuring such a complex system is thoroughly tested.
- **Communication:** Coordinating clear communications among team members with differing perspectives, methodologies, and schedules.

**Effort Involved:**

Overall, this project required roughly 2 times the effort of AB3, primarily due to the additional complexity and volume of content implemented.

- **Enhanced Wedding Management System ★★★**
  - Complete redesign of the underlying data model to support multiple wedding events with various associated data points.
  - Created new data models for Wedding, WeddingTask, and associated classes.
  - Implemented a unique ID system for weddings to ensure consistent referencing.
  - Developed validation logic for wedding dates to ensure they are valid and in the future.
  - Designed and implemented a tagging system to associate contacts with specific weddings.
  - Added specialized commands for wedding management (addWedding, editWedding, deleteWedding).


- **Task Management System ★★**
  - Designed a task model that supports descriptions and completion status.
  - Integrated tasks directly into the wedding model for natural organization.
  - Created specialized commands for task operations (addTask, listTask, mark, unmark, deleteTask).
  - Implemented validation to ensure tasks are associated with valid weddings.


- **Enhanced Contact Management ★★★**
  - Extended the Person model to include role information essential for wedding planning.
  - Implemented a robust tagging system to associate contacts with multiple weddings.
  - Created specialized filtering mechanisms to view contacts by wedding or role.
  - Improved the contact display to show relevant wedding associations.


- **UI Enhancements ★★**
  - Created a split-panel design to show both weddings and contacts simultaneously.
  - Implemented a detailed view for wedding tasks and related information.
  - Added visual indicators for tagged relationships between contacts and weddings.
  - Designed a comprehensive output display for command results.


- **Storage Component Expansion ★★**
  - Extended the JSON storage format to include wedding and task data.
  - Implemented bidirectional references for weddings and contacts.
  - Ensured data integrity during save/load operations.
  - Added validation to handle potential data corruption scenarios.


- **Comprehensive Testing ★★★**
  - Created extensive integration tests for wedding-contact relationships.
  - Developed unit tests for all new commands and features.
  - Conducted manual testing sessions for complex workflows.
  - Implemented edge case testing for data validation.


**Accomplishments:**

Despite the challenges, our team successfully:
- Implemented a robust data model that effectively manages the relationships between contacts, weddings, and tasks.
- Developed a comprehensive set of commands that allow users to interact with the system in a meaningful way.
- Ensured that the application is thoroughly tested, with a high level of code coverage.
- Added significant new functionality, including the ability to add, delete, and edit contacts, weddings, and tasks, and tag people to different weddings.

**Library Usage and Reuse:**  
Critical libraries played a key role in streamlining our work:
- **JUnit 5:** Extensively used for unit testing, improving code quality and reducing testing time by an estimated 15-20% compared to writing tests from scratch.
- **JavaFX:** Employed to build the Graphical User Interface (GUI), significantly accelerating the implementation process.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**
Team size: 5

The following planned enhancements target future improvements for EasyWeds. Each enhancement describes a feature gap in the current system and outlines the proposed solution along with the expected benefits. This section lists enhancements that focus on advancing wedding task management and overall user experience.

### 1. Integrate Task Deadlines
- **Feature Gap**: Wedding tasks currently lack deadline functionality, which limits the ability to prioritize and track upcoming work.
- **Proposed Fix**: Add deadlines to each wedding task, enabling users to assign due dates and times.
- **Expected Outcome**: Improved task management with clear deadlines, leading to better prioritization and timely completion of tasks.

### 2. Advanced Task Filtering and Sorting by Deadline
- **Feature Gap**: Users are currently unable to quickly identify urgent tasks since the task list lacks filtering and sorting by deadline.
- **Proposed Fix**: Enhance the task management interface to include options for filtering and sorting wedding tasks based on their assigned deadlines. 
- **Expected Outcome**: Faster identification of high-priority tasks and improved workflow through better visual organization.

### 3. Support for Non-Latin Characters in Names
- **Feature Gap**: Currently, only alphanumeric Latin characters are allowed for the name field, which may exclude users whose names include non-Latin characters (e.g.,Chinese, Arabic).
- **Proposed Fix**: Revise the validation rules for the name field to accept non-Latin characters while maintaining data integrity. This could involve updating the regex patterns and ensuring compatibility with the rest of the system.
- **Expected Outcome**: Increased inclusivity and usability for international users, allowing a more diverse range of names to be stored accurately within EasyWeds.

### 4. Expanded Search Capabilities
- **Feature Gap**: The current search functionality only supports exact keyword matching, which may lead to difficulties when users mistype names or use abbreviations.
- **Proposed Fix**: Implement a fuzzy search algorithm and support for partial matches, so that slight misspellings or incomplete queries still return relevant results.
- **Expected Outcome**: Users will experience more forgiving and intuitive search behavior, making it easier to locate contacts and events even with minor input errors.

### 5. Batch Tag/Untag Contacts
- **Feature Gap**: Currently, users must tag or untag contacts to weddings one by one. For large weddings with many vendors and clients, this process is time-consuming and inefficient.
- **Proposed Fix**: Implement a batch tagging system that allows users to select multiple contacts and tag or untag them to a wedding in a single command.
- **Expected Outcome**: Wedding planners will experience a significant reduction in administrative overhead, leading to a more efficient workflow when managing contacts for large events.

### 6. Better Wedding ID handling after deletion
- **Feature Gap**: When a wedding is deleted, its ID is not reused, which results in non-sequential wedding IDs (e.g., W1, W3, W4). This inconsistency can confuse users and wastes available identifiers.
- **Proposed Fix**: Implement proper wedding ID management that either reuses IDs from deleted weddings for new entries, or provides an optional command to renumber/reindex all wedding IDs sequentially.\
- **Expected Outcome**: Wedding IDs will be managed more effectively, eliminating gaps and providing users with a clear and organized identifier sequence for all weddings.
